== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby Apriori is a library to efficiently find item association rules within
large sets of transactions. This library provides a Ruby interface to Christian
Borgelt's C implementation of this algorithm.

From Christian Borgelt's Apriori:http://www.borgelt.net/apriori.html documentation: 

  Association rule induction is a powerful method for so-called market basket
  analysis, which aims at finding regularities in the shopping behavior of
  customers.

  With the induction of association rules one tries to find sets of
  products that are frequently bought together, so that from the presence of
  certain products in a shopping cart one can infer (with a high probability)
  that certain other products are present. 

  An association rule is a rule like "If a customer buys wine and bread, he often
  buys cheese, too."

  An association rule states that if we pick a customer at random and find out
  that he selected certain items (bought certain products, chose certain options
  etc.), we can be confident, quantified by a percentage, that he also selected
  certain other items (bought certain other products, chose certain other options
  etc.).

This Ruby library provides a convenient way to use this algorithm from Ruby.

Original Apriori C code by Christian Borgelt. 

== THE ALGORITHM:

This document is not an introduction to the Apriori algorithm. To find out more about Apriori see:

* http://www.borgelt.net/papers/cstat_02.pdf
* http://www.borgelt.net/papers/fimi_03.pdf
* http://www.borgelt.net/apriori.html
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm

== FEATURES:

* Supports easy use from Ruby data types
* Supports large data files

== EXAMPLE USAGE:

  require 'apriori'

  transactions = [  %w{beer doritos},
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{beer doritos}, 
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{apple doritos} ]

  rules = Apriori.find_association_rules(transactions,
                            :min_items => 2,
                            :max_items => 5,
                            :min_support => 1, 
                            :max_support => 100, 
                            :min_confidence => 20)

  puts rules.join("\n")

  # Results: 
  # beer -> doritos (33.3/2, 100.0)
  # doritos -> beer (50.0/3, 66.7)
  # doritos -> apple (50.0/3, 33.3)
  # apple -> doritos (66.7/4, 25.0)
  # cheese -> apple (50.0/3, 100.0)
  # apple -> cheese (66.7/4, 75.0)

  # NOTE:
  # beer -> doritos (33.3/2, 100.0)
  # means: 
  # * beer appears in 33.3% (2 total) of the transactions (the support)
  # * beer implies doritos 100% of the time (the confidence)

See the +examples+ directory for more examples of usage.

== EXAMPLE DATA:

Example data can be found at:

http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data/

== REQUIREMENTS:

This library is compiled using a slightly modified version of Christian
Borgelt's original C implementation of Apriori. The original code can be found
at: http://www.borgelt.net/apriori.html

* +gcc+ or similar compiler
* <tt>ruby.h</tt>

== INSTALL:

* gem install --source http://gems.github.com jashmenn-apriori

== FAQ:

If you get the error:

  undefined method `add_development_dependency' for #<Gem::Specification:0x2aabcba63ed8>

This is because hoe 1.7.0 requires rubygems 1.2.0. To upgrade, simply do the following:

  gem update --system
